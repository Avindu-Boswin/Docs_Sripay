                    Governing Law and Arbitration
                    This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Republic of Sri Lanka.
                    Any dispute, controversy,
                    difference or claim arising out of or in relation to this Agreement must be settled
                    amicably by the
                    parties. If parties fail to resolve the Dispute amicably the Dispute may be referred by
                    either party for
                    resolution to arbitration to the exclusion of all other forums, the result of which shall be
                    final and
                    binding on the parties. Any such arbitration will be administered by the Sri Lanka
                    National Arbitration
                    Centre (“SLNAC”) under the UNCITRAL Rules then in force. The seat of the arbitration
                    will be Sri
                    Lanka and the law of this arbitration clause shall be Sri Lankan. The arbitration tribunal
                    will comprise
                    one arbitrator, who is experienced in international payments disputes, jointly selected by
                    the parties and
                    failing agreement by the parties on such joint selection, by SLNAC. The language of the
                    arbitration
                    shall be English. Any such arbitration must permit the holding of the tribunal proceeding
                    virtually by
                    video conference.
